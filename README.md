[OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu) is an infrastructure-as-code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. It is hosted by the Linux Foundation.

This repo contains materials for the Massdriver webinar on migrating OpenTofu modules into Massdriver bundles.
